/*2) Employees
2.1>>Create a class called Employee whose objects are records for an employee. 
\This class will be a derived class of the class Person which you will have to 
copy into a file of your own and compile. An employee record has an employeeâ€™s name 
(inherited from the class Person), an annual salary represented as a single value of type double, a year the employee started work as a single value of type int and a national insurance number,
 which is a value of type String.
2.2>>Your class should have a reasonable number of constructors and accessor methods, 
as well as an equals method. Write another class containing a main method to 
fully test your class definition.*/
